SEI-49 project 3 (MERN)
This app is a game for dog lovers that does not have the time to take care of real life dogs to have a virtual dog to take care of. The player will have virtual dog that will have stats that they will have to fill up, if not the dog will run away. You will have three tasks that will refresh every day for you to do for your dog. Note that should you fail any of these task, your dog will not like you and will run away if you failed the dog.

# Next Steps

Future enhancement one: adding dog animation
Currently, there are no animations or image to show the user what happens when you do the task. There is only text that shows when you do one of the actions.

Future enhancement two: adding more interaction with the dog
Currently, there is only three interactions with the dog. We would like to include many other interactions that the dog would like and improve on the specific interactions.
